My research focuses on employing inter-disciplinary computational approaches to understand
how mechanical and chemical properties of biological materials are tuned to enable specific functional
goals. Examples include dynamic biological patterns of self-assembly in actin bundles, and
signal-cytoskeleton relationship in growing axons.
